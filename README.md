# OnePlayerSleepingIsEnough

As name  describes, this plugin allow to change ingame daytime from night to day or from thunderstorm to clear weather (like vanilla sleeping).
Except only one player is needed to sleep to change it.

## Motivation

On our server we were looking for plugin with this simple vanilla functionality, but we haven't found any working stable or without bugs. A datapack was found but was broken either.

So this plugin does that right and only that, nothing else. 

**Plugin has no configuration or commands.**
